# Job Finder Mobile App Specification

## Project Overview

The Job Finder app is a dynamic job discovery platform that transforms the job search experience through an innovative, multi-modal profile creation process and intelligent matching interface. Using a Tinder-like swiping mechanism, users can quickly discover and interact with job opportunities that match their preferences and skills.

## Core Features

### 1. Job Discovery Interface

- **Tinder-like Swiping**: Users can swipe right to express interest in a job or swipe left to discard it
- **Card-based UI**: Each job is displayed as a card with key information (title, company, location, salary)
- **Job Details**: Tapping on a job card reveals detailed information including full description, requirements, and company details
- **Emoji Reactions**: Users can express their sentiment about a job using emoji reactions (excited, interested, neutral, doubtful, negative)

### 2. Progressive Profile Creation

The app implements a step-by-step profile creation process:

- **Anonymous Browsing**: Users can start browsing jobs immediately without creating an account
- **Progressive Modals**: After several interactions, the app prompts users to complete their profile through a series of focused modal screens
- **Profile Steps**:
  1. Basic Profile: Professional title, years of experience
  2. Work Preferences: Schedule type, work mode, minimum salary, travel willingness
  3. Education: Highest level, field of study, certifications
  4. Languages: Primary language and proficiency, additional languages
  5. CV Upload: Upload resume/CV document
  6. Registration: Create account with username/password to save progress

### 3. User Account Features

- **Profile Management**: View and edit personal information and preferences
- **Saved Jobs**: Access list of jobs the user has expressed interest in
- **Applied Jobs**: Track jobs the user has formally applied to
- **Occupation Preferences**: Browse and select preferred occupations to improve recommendations

### 4. Location & Language Support

- **Geolocation**: Uses device location (with permission) to recommend nearby jobs
- **Multi-language Support**: Automatic language detection between English and Spanish based on user location
- **Remote/Hybrid/On-site Filtering**: Filter jobs by work arrangement with visual indicators

### 5. Smart Recommendations

- **Learning Algorithm**: System learns from user interactions to improve job recommendations over time
- **Similarity Matching**: Suggests jobs similar to those the user has liked previously
